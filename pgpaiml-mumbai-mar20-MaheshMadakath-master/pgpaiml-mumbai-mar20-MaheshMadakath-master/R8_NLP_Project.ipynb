       "      <td>I just had a lovely memory of a most beautiful town square in India. Rishikesh to be precise. The town is most famous in the West for the visits The Beatles made to it in the sixties, but even in India it is well known. The town sits in the foothills of the Himalaya, straddling the newly born River Ganges. 25kms or so down river is Haridwar, one of the sites of the quadrennial religious gathering known as the  urlLink Kumbha Mela ; the largest gathering of humanity on the planet. As both Haridwar and Rishikesh are holy towns, meat is forbidden. They are strictly vegetarian towns.  Rishikesh itself is split into two parts, the main town, which is a very hectic, typically Indian town, full of blaring horns and holy cows. But on the far side of the river there is a part of the town where cars cannot come, populated by ashrams and the occasional guest house. To get there, one must take a boat or cross  urlLink a lovely footbridge  (which was built by the British during WWII). On the peak of the hill on that quiet side of town, there is a very serene, and seemingly very ancient, town square, which I stumbled across late one afternoon in 1993.  The afternoon light was lovely, and there were many sahdus (Indian holy men) sitting around. One sahdu was standing, but leaning on a swing hanging from a large tree. 'He's been standing for nearly 10 years', one of the sahdus later told me proudly. 'He sleeps standing, he eats standing, he even shits standing'. Wow, I thought. Impressive.  I smoked a chillum with a few of the sahdus as the light went from yellow to gold and the afternoon shone in its final glory. Whether it was the surroundings, the light, or just the hash, I will never be sure (most likely it was a combination of all three), but I felt a connection to the human social condition that afternoon that I have never felt since. The symbolism of the town square was intensely powerful - particularly without the modern irritations of traffic, noise or advertising. People came and went about their business, as they purchased vegetables for the evening meal, or just sat and talked to their neighbours at the end of the day. I was very envious of the standing sahdu. It was certainly a nice place to hang around (groan..) for a decade. Not that I envied him his feat of religious asceticism.  Just the view.</td>\n",

It seems that one of my readers was not satisfied with the way I trailed off about the girls I met in the Dells. While I had more important things to do then meet with girls, I did spend a hefty amount of time with them.   The three girl's phone numbers I had previously announced I had are still in safe-keeping. I plan on calling 0 out of 3 of these girls and I will have nothing to do with any of them. The perfect girl in the pool, however, is a different story. There were two different pools in area that the guys and I swam in. Hence, there were two perfect girls; one in each pool. I apologize to the reader who had expected the number of pools to be at least ten so that there could be ten perfect girls in the world.   Anyways, while I'm on the subject, I did get to spend some time with one of the more attractive of the girls I met. She was a stunning dirty blonde with eyes that could make your legs weaken, lips that could make a grown man cry, and a smile that would melt the heart of any male. She had a cool demeanor and a strong aura of a rebel when I was near her. As much as I tried to get close to her, her independent aura made me back down like a kitten from a pit bull, afraid that she would reject me and leave. Luckily she did neither and we talked for what seemed like five minutes but in all actuality was more like two hours. I actually had the courage to ask her if she wanted to kiss...  'No.' she said. My heart sank. I was rejected. Well, it was worth a shot I had told myself. But then she added something that made my heart shoot back into my rib-cage. 'I can't. My mom is right behind the big dolphin.' Oh, thank God for the big dolphin. I had been saved by a six foot long plastic dolphin. I wanted nothing more than to hold her in my arms at the very least before I had to go, but it was cut short because I had to return to my hotel room for curfew.   Who knew that on one fateful night during a Wisconsin trip, I would meet the perfect girl. Someone to talk to, laugh with, and just have a good time with, without worrying about what anyone would say or do about it. I wish I could say I plan on meeting this girl again, but I don't. I do not see how that could be possible at all being in the great state of Indiana while my angel is in the equally as great, but very far away state of Minnesota.  The great thing is, I think Mariah felt the same about me. That's right, Mariah. Mariah Robinson. I leave you to ponder your own love story, reader.

       "      <td>You may recall that I had had pretty darn good vision after my recent cataract surgery, and I was (exceedingly) happy.  But my vision gradually degraded, as 50% of all cataract surgeries do, due to a clouding of the membrane that separates the lens from the back of the eye.  It was a gradual, but in the end, quite noticeable decline in acuity.  Well, I just got back from a quick outpatient procedure to correct this, and it couldn't have been more trouble-free.  To destroy the errant membrane, they shine multiple laser picobursts into your eye (about 20 to 30 of them), each one of which causes a pressure wave that punches a hole through the membrane.  Actually, a great metaphor that the surgeon used is that you should imagine a tightly-stretched film of Saran Wrap.   If you take a pin and pop a hole in the film, you'll get far more destruction than just a little hole, because the film is stretched so tightly.  So, I sat down, and he aimed his laser this way and that, popping the film with his laser bursts, until the membrane was essentially destroyed.  It was slightly startling, because I could FEEL the shock wave in the eye (like throwing a stone into a calm pond).  It took about three to five minutes - I didn't have to change out of my street clothes, even.  Many have asked, 'Don't you need all of your various body parts? Wasn't that part there for some reason?'  Well, it does more or less hold your lens in place, but the artificial lens that they put in during the cataract operation is sufficiently anchored down after 6 to 8 weeks that they can proceed with the destruction of the membrane.  And the results?  Amazing.  Using my evil eye, I after the operation, I could read the little badges on the cars with the brand name spelled out ('Mercury') from a distance of several car lengths.  And, for actual before-and-after comparison, I had put a large book (The Way To Cook, Julia Child, hardcover) against the piano and had seen how many paces away from the book I had to be before I couldn't read its title any more.  All tests were made with the evil eye open, and the excellent eye shut. Before the operation, WITH my glasses, I could just read the book title from about 8 feet away.  After the operation, WITHOUT my glasses, I could read the book from 10 feet away, and WITH my glasses, I could still read it from 23 feet away.  I might have been able to do a little better, but I ran out of living room.  So, almost a three-fold improvement in acuity, like going from 20/90 to 20/30.   Naturally, I'm thrilled.  (Even as I'm writing this just now, I can't help being tickled at how sharp everything looks).  I'm pretty confident now that even should my excellent eye suddenly have some horrible mishap, I would still easily qualify to drive with just my evil eye, especially if they would consent to clearing the freeways every morning and evening for my convenience.  And it's clearly good enough for me to be able to depend on it for reading and working, even should the other one fail.  The evil eye still has the dread macular pucker (the scar tissue on the retina, which makes things a bit wavy), and I'm still taking eye drops every day to prevent the retina from swelling, and my eye still LOOKS a little evil, but from the inside looking out, I'm deeply satisfied.  The retinal surgeon has no intention of operating on the macular pucker any time soon, so hopefully you won't hear from me about my dopey eye for a long, long time.  -Tom</td>\n",

       "30648   4252371  ...         I just had a lovely memory of a most beautiful town square in India. Rishikesh to be precise. The town is most famous in the West for the visits The Beatles made to it in the sixties, but even in India it is well known. The town sits in the foothills of the Himalaya, straddling the newly born River Ganges. 25kms or so down river is Haridwar, one of the sites of the quadrennial religious gathering known as the  urlLink Kumbha Mela ; the largest gathering of humanity on the planet. As both Haridwar and Rishikesh are holy towns, meat is forbidden. They are strictly vegetarian towns.  Rishikesh itself is split into two parts, the main town, which is a very hectic, typically Indian town, full of blaring horns and holy cows. But on the far side of the river there is a part of the town where cars cannot come, populated by ashrams and the occasional guest house. To get there, one must take a boat or cross  urlLink a lovely footbridge  (which was built by the British during WWII). On the peak of the hill on that quiet side of town, there is a very serene, and seemingly very ancient, town square, which I stumbled across late one afternoon in 1993.  The afternoon light was lovely, and there were many sahdus (Indian holy men) sitting around. One sahdu was standing, but leaning on a swing hanging from a large tree. 'He's been standing for nearly 10 years', one of the sahdus later told me proudly. 'He sleeps standing, he eats standing, he even shits standing'. Wow, I thought. Impressive.  I smoked a chillum with a few of the sahdus as the light went from yellow to gold and the afternoon shone in its final glory. Whether it was the surroundings, the light, or just the hash, I will never be sure (most likely it was a combination of all three), but I felt a connection to the human social condition that afternoon that I have never felt since. The symbolism of the town square was intensely powerful - particularly without the modern irritations of traffic, noise or advertising. People came and went about their business, as they purchased vegetables for the evening meal, or just sat and talked to their neighbours at the end of the day. I was very envious of the standing sahdu. It was certainly a nice place to hang around (groan..) for a decade. Not that I envied him his feat of religious asceticism.  Just the view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "572235  3745396  ...         Back by popular demand is the third and final installment of Wisconsin Dells saga. It seems that one of my readers was not satisfied with the way I trailed off about the girls I met in the Dells. While I had more important things to do then meet with girls, I did spend a hefty amount of time with them.   The three girl's phone numbers I had previously announced I had are still in safe-keeping. I plan on calling 0 out of 3 of these girls and I will have nothing to do with any of them. The perfect girl in the pool, however, is a different story. There were two different pools in area that the guys and I swam in. Hence, there were two perfect girls; one in each pool. I apologize to the reader who had expected the number of pools to be at least ten so that there could be ten perfect girls in the world.   Anyways, while I'm on the subject, I did get to spend some time with one of the more attractive of the girls I met. She was a stunning dirty blonde with eyes that could make your legs weaken, lips that could make a grown man cry, and a smile that would melt the heart of any male. She had a cool demeanor and a strong aura of a rebel when I was near her. As much as I tried to get close to her, her independent aura made me back down like a kitten from a pit bull, afraid that she would reject me and leave. Luckily she did neither and we talked for what seemed like five minutes but in all actuality was more like two hours. I actually had the courage to ask her if she wanted to kiss...  'No.' she said. My heart sank. I was rejected. Well, it was worth a shot I had told myself. But then she added something that made my heart shoot back into my rib-cage. 'I can't. My mom is right behind the big dolphin.' Oh, thank God for the big dolphin. I had been saved by a six foot long plastic dolphin. I wanted nothing more than to hold her in my arms at the very least before I had to go, but it was cut short because I had to return to my hotel room for curfew.   Who knew that on one fateful night during a Wisconsin trip, I would meet the perfect girl. Someone to talk to, laugh with, and just have a good time with, without worrying about what anyone would say or do about it. I wish I could say I plan on meeting this girl again, but I don't. I do not see how that could be possible at all being in the great state of Indiana while my angel is in the equally as great, but very far away state of Minnesota.  The great thing is, I think Mariah felt the same about me. That's right, Mariah. Mariah Robinson. I leave you to ponder your own love story, reader. As I stroll off to bed wiping a single tear from my eye wondering myself, what could have been...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "228627  3297995  ...               You may recall that I had had pretty darn good vision after my recent cataract surgery, and I was (exceedingly) happy.  But my vision gradually degraded, as 50% of all cataract surgeries do, due to a clouding of the membrane that separates the lens from the back of the eye.  It was a gradual, but in the end, quite noticeable decline in acuity.  Well, I just got back from a quick outpatient procedure to correct this, and it couldn't have been more trouble-free.  To destroy the errant membrane, they shine multiple laser picobursts into your eye (about 20 to 30 of them), each one of which causes a pressure wave that punches a hole through the membrane.  Actually, a great metaphor that the surgeon used is that you should imagine a tightly-stretched film of Saran Wrap.   If you take a pin and pop a hole in the film, you'll get far more destruction than just a little hole, because the film is stretched so tightly.  So, I sat down, and he aimed his laser this way and that, popping the film with his laser bursts, until the membrane was essentially destroyed.  It was slightly startling, because I could FEEL the shock wave in the eye (like throwing a stone into a calm pond).  It took about three to five minutes - I didn't have to change out of my street clothes, even.  Many have asked, 'Don't you need all of your various body parts? Wasn't that part there for some reason?'  Well, it does more or less hold your lens in place, but the artificial lens that they put in during the cataract operation is sufficiently anchored down after 6 to 8 weeks that they can proceed with the destruction of the membrane.  And the results?  Amazing.  Using my evil eye, I after the operation, I could read the little badges on the cars with the brand name spelled out ('Mercury') from a distance of several car lengths.  And, for actual before-and-after comparison, I had put a large book (The Way To Cook, Julia Child, hardcover) against the piano and had seen how many paces away from the book I had to be before I couldn't read its title any more.  All tests were made with the evil eye open, and the excellent eye shut. Before the operation, WITH my glasses, I could just read the book title from about 8 feet away.  After the operation, WITHOUT my glasses, I could read the book from 10 feet away, and WITH my glasses, I could still read it from 23 feet away.  I might have been able to do a little better, but I ran out of living room.  So, almost a three-fold improvement in acuity, like going from 20/90 to 20/30.   Naturally, I'm thrilled.  (Even as I'm writing this just now, I can't help being tickled at how sharp everything looks).  I'm pretty confident now that even should my excellent eye suddenly have some horrible mishap, I would still easily qualify to drive with just my evil eye, especially if they would consent to clearing the freeways every morning and evening for my convenience.  And it's clearly good enough for me to be able to depend on it for reading and working, even should the other one fail.  The evil eye still has the dread macular pucker (the scar tissue on the retina, which makes things a bit wavy), and I'm still taking eye drops every day to prevent the retina from swelling, and my eye still LOOKS a little evil, but from the inside looking out, I'm deeply satisfied.  The retinal surgeon has no intention of operating on the macular pucker any time soon, so hopefully you won't hear from me about my dopey eye for a long, long time.  -Tom         \n",
